**Introduction** <br>
**-> Physical Security is often overlooked but critical in red team ops, because weak locks and access controls can bypass even strong cyber defenses. Basic skills like lock picking and physical bypass techniques complete a real‑world attack surface mindset.**

**Overt, Covert, and Surreptitious Entry** <br>
**-> Overt, Covert, and Surreptitious Entry are methods to access physical locations: Overt causes visible damage, Covert is mostly undetectable to untrained people, and Surreptitious leaves no trace even to trained investigators. Using an angle grinder or breaking a window is Overt, lock picking can be Covert or Surreptitious depending on trace, and taking a photo of a key or spying on a safe combo is Surreptitious.**
<br><br>

**1) Using an angle grinder to cut a lock open is what type of entry?** <br>
**-> 1**
<br><br>
**2) Lock picking could be considered what type of entry?** <br>
**-> 2**
<br><br>

**Lock Picking** <br>
**-> Lock Picking basics revolve around manipulating a pin‑tumbler lock by applying controlled rotation with a tension wrench, then setting pins individually using Single Pin Picking, commonly abbreviated SPP; randomly scrubbing pins instead is called raking. Cheap, low‑security locks like office desk cabinets are typically wafer locks, while a hook pick is the standard profile for SPP. When a pin sets and the core turns slightly, that feedback is called a false set, and the security pin that produces multiple clicks while picking is a serrated pin.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) What is the name of the tool which is used to apply torque to the core of a lock when picking?** <br>
**-> Tension Wrench**
<br><br>
**2) What is the term used for picking a single pin at a time?** <br>
**-> Single Pin Picking**
<br><br>
**3) What is the abbreviation commonly used to reference the above answer?** <br>
**-> SPP**
<br><br>
**4) What is the term used when you try to randomly set pins?** <br>
**-> Raking**
<br><br>
**5) This type of lock is typically cheap, low quality, and found on low security applications such as office desk cabinets.** <br>
**-> Wafer Lock**
<br><br>
**6) This type of pick profile is usually used when single pin picking.** <br>
**-> Hook**
<br><br>
**7) When single pin picking, this term refers to when you feel like you have set a pin and the core rotates slightly** <br>
**-> False Set**
<br><br>
**8) This type of security driver pin gives several clicks as it is being picked.** <br>
**-> Serrated**

**Lock Anatomy** <br>
**-> Lock anatomy fundamentals center on how components interact to prevent rotation: the interface between the two pins in a stack is the shear line, the bottom pins are key pins, and the top pins are driver pins. Padlocks use ball bearings as non‑shimmable elements to retain the shackle, the cam allows locking lugs to retract when the core turns, the deadlatch plunger must stay fully depressed to prevent loiding, and the locking mechanism with a bolt extending into the door frame is a deadbolt.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) What is the interface between the two pins in a pin stack referred to as?** <br>
**-> Shear Line**
<br><br>
**2) What are the pins on the bottom half of a pin stack referred to as? (you don't have to enter the word pin in the answer)** <br>
**-> Key**
<br><br>
**3) What are the pins on the top half of a pin stack referred to as? (you don't have to enter the word pin in the answer)** <br>
**-> Driver**
<br><br>
**4) What non-shimmable elements do padlocks use to keep the shackle in place?** <br>
**-> Ball Bearings**
<br><br>
**5) What is the piece that allows locking lugs to retract when the core is turned?** <br>
**-> Actuator**
<br><br>
**6) What piece of a standard door latch should remain completely depressed when the door is closed to prevent loiding/slipping of the latch?** <br>
**-> Dead latch**
<br><br>
**7) What is the locking mechanism that has a bolt which protrudes into the frame of the door preventing it from opening?** <br>
**-> Deadbolt**

**Padlock Bypassing** <br>
**-> Padlock bypassing basics rely on exploiting weak retention and design flaws: unshielded locks are vulnerable to shims, spring‑loaded locking lugs can be defeated with a shim, combination locks like the Masterlock 5400D leak codes via decoding, and the Masterlock 175 is known for shim bypass. Using a lowest‑cut key with kinetic force is bump keying, tapping the lock body to release spring lugs is hammer bypass, lifting all pins at once exploits a comb pick, and wafer locks can often be opened with jigglers (try‑out keys).**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) A lock which is unshielded is susceptible to what bypass tool?** <br>
**-> Knife**
<br><br>
**2) A lock which has spring loaded locking lugs rather than ball bearings can be bypassed with what tool?** <br>
**-> Shim**
<br><br>
**3) Combination locks such as the Masterlock 5400D are susceptible to a bypass which reveals the combination What is this method known as?** <br>
**-> Decoding**
<br><br>
**4) The Masterlock 175 is infamous for its ability to be bypassed using what type of bypass?** <br>
**-> Mini Knife**
<br><br>
**5) What bypass method uses a key cut to the lowest depths and kinetic energy to bounce the driver pins above the shear line and allow a lock to be opened?** <br>
**-> Bumping**
<br><br>
**6) Locks which have spring loaded locking lugs can be opened by tapping a hammer on the side of the lock. What is this attack method called?** <br>
**-> Rapping**
<br><br>
**7) What type of pick takes advantage of lazy manufacturing practices by lifting all the key pins and driver pins above the shear line to bypass a lock?** <br>
**-> Comb**
<br><br>
**8) What tools can be wiggled inside the keyway of wafer locks to roughly simulate the biting of the key and open the lock?** <br>
**-> Jiggler**

**Hardware Bypassing** <br>
**-> Hardware bypassing focuses on defeating doors without touching the lock: an under‑the‑door tool can actuate interior handles, a crash bar tool bypasses double doors with panic bars, and an air wedge widens door gaps for tool insertion. An improperly hung outward‑opening door can be bypassed with a pry bar or door spreader, while Kevlar or strong cord/strap can go over the door to pull handles when under‑door tools fail. Canned air can bypass motion sensors (PIR), and shielded/blocked keyways or a rotating curtain can prevent the Adams Rite wire‑through‑keyway bypass.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) What tool is used to reach under a door and actuate a handle from the interior?** <br>
**-> Under The Door Tool**
<br><br>
**2) What tool can be used to bypass a set of double doors which have a crash bar on the secure side?** <br>
**-> Double Door Tool**
<br><br>
**3) What item can be used to widen the gaps between doors and door frames or between double doors to allow for other bypass tools to be used? This tool is also common for automobile entry.** <br>
**-> Air Wedge**
<br><br>
**4) An improperly hung door which opens away from you can be bypassed using this type of tool?** <br>
**-> Shim**
<br><br>
**5) An improperly hung door which opens away from you can be bypassed using this type of tool?** <br>
**-> Traveler Hook**
<br><br>
**6) What type of material can be used to go over the door to grab the secure side handles when an under the door tool is not able to be used?** <br>
**-> Film**
<br><br>
**7) Canned air can be used to bypass what type of door controller hardware?** <br>
**-> REX sensor**
<br><br>
**8) Adams Rite hardware fixtures are susceptible to a bypass where a wire is snaked through the keyway and actuates the locking mechanism behind it, what could prevent this bypass?** <br>
**-> Shielding**
