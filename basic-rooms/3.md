**Methodology Outline** <br>
**-> The Process that pentesters follow is summarized in the following steps:** <br>
**1) Reconnaissance** <br>
**2) Enumeration/Scanning** <br>
**3) Gaining Access** <br>
**4) Privilege Escalation** <br>
**5) Covering Tracks** <br>
**6) Reporting** <br>
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) What is the first phase of the Hacker Methodology?** <br>
**-> Reconnaissance**

**Reconnaissance Overview** <br>
**-> Reconnaissance is the passive intelligence‑gathering phase where a hacker uses public sources like Google, Wikipedia, LinkedIn, and tech‑fingerprinting sites to understand a target before any interaction. For SpaceX, recon quickly reveals that the CEO is Elon Musk, the company’s structure, and technology footprint; Sublist3r helps by listing subdomains, expanding the visible attack surface. Using advanced Google search operators to find exposed data or weaknesses is called Google Dorking-simple tools, maximum strategic value.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) Who is the CEO of SpaceX?** <br>
**-> Elon Musk**
<br><br>
**2) Do some research into the tool: sublist3r, what does it list?** <br>
**-> subdomains**
<br><br>
**3) What is it called when you use Google to look for specific vulnerabilities or to research a specific topic of interest?** <br>
**-> Google Dorking**

<br>
<br>

**Enumeration and Scanning Overview** <br>
**-> Scanning and Enumeration is the phase where a hacker actively interacts with the target to map its attack surface by identifying live hosts, open ports, running services, versions, users, shares, and misconfigurations-essentially determining what the target might be vulnerable to before exploitation. Enumeration helps determine exposed services, software versions, and accessible resources that can be attacked. Metasploit was developed by Rapid7, and the technology behind Burp Suite was developed by PortSwigger-specialized tools, deliberate interaction, maximum signal.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) What does enumeration help to determine about the target?** <br>
**-> Attack Surface**
<br><br>
**2) Do some reconnaissance about the tool: Metasploit, what company developed it?** <br>
**-> Rapid7**
<br><br>
**3) What company developed the technology behind the tool Burp Suite?** <br>
**-> portswigger**

<br>
<br>

**Exploitation** <br>
**-> Exploitation is where a pentester leverages validated vulnerabilities discovered during reconnaissance and enumeration to gain access or impact a target-execution depends entirely on prior intelligence.
A primary exploitation tool used by pentesters is Metasploit.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) What is one of the primary exploitation tools that pentester(s) use?** <br>
**-> Metasploit**

<br>
<br>

**Privilege Escalation** <br>
**-> Privilege Escalation is the phase where a pentester upgrades access from a low‑privilege user to full control by abusing misconfigurations, weak credentials, vulnerable services, or exposed secrets-because initial access without higher privileges is operationally useless. In Windows, the other high‑value target account besides Administrator is SYSTEM, and an SSH private key can allow login to another machine even without knowing a username or password.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) In Windows what is usually the other target account besides Administrator?** <br>
**-> System**
<br><br>
**2) What thing related to SSH could allow you to login to another machine (even without knowing the username or password)?** <br>
**-> Keys**

<br>
<br>

**Covering Tracks** <br>
**-> Covering Tracks exists in the methodology but is rarely used by ethical hackers, because professional penetration tests are pre‑authorized, scoped, and time‑bound. Once privilege escalation is achieved, a pentester stops immediately, reports findings, and helps with cleanup and remediation rather than hiding activity. The real responsibility here is documentation-clearly recording every action taken so the system owner can fix vulnerabilities and prevent future attacks.**

**Questions:** <br>
**1) I read this section!** <br>

<br>
<br>

**Reporting** <br>
**-> Reporting is the final and most business‑critical phase, where a pentester documents all discovered vulnerabilities, their impact, how they were found, and how to fix them-this is the deliverable that drives remediation and risk decisions. The reporting type that includes full documentation in a formal document is a Full Formal Report, and beyond the finding name, description, and criticality, a pentester must also provide remediation recommendations.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) What would be the type of reporting that involves a full documentation of all findings within a formal document?** <br>
**-> full formal report**
<br><br>
**2) What is the other thing that a pentester should provide in a report beyond: the finding name, the finding description, the finding criticality** <br>
**-> remediation recommendation**
