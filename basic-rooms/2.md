**What is Penetration Testing?** <br>
**-> A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.**

**Penetration Testing Ethics** <br>
**-> Penetration testing is legal hacking only when explicitly authorised by the system owner and constrained by an agreed scope. Anything outside that scope is illegal. Ethics may still be challenged even when actions are legal. Clear rules, accreditation, and formal agreements separate legitimate security testing from criminal activity.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) You are given permission to perform a security audit on an organisation; what type of hacker would you be?** <br>
**-> White Hat**
<br><br>
**2) You attack an organisation and steal their data, what type of hacker would you be?** <br>
**-> Black Hat**
<br><br>
**3) What document defines how a penetration testing engagement should be carried out?** <br>
**-> Rules of Engagement**

<br>

**Penetration Testing Methodologies** <br>
**-> Penetration testing methodology is a structured, situation-based approach that adapts to the target and scope, generally following stages like information gathering, scanning, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation, with frameworks such as OSSTMM used for testing telecommunications and network communications and OWASP used specifically for assessing the security of web applications and services.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) What stage of penetration testing involves using publicly available information?** <br>
**-> Information Gathering**
<br><br>
**2) If you wanted to use a framework for pentesting telecommunications, what framework would you use? Note: We're looking for the acronym here and not the full name.** <br>
**-> OSSTMM**
<br><br>
**3) What framework focuses on the testing of web applications?** <br>
**-> OWASP**

<br>

**Black box, White box, Grey box Penetration Testing** <br>
**-> Black‑box, grey‑box, and white‑box testing define penetration testing scope based on tester knowledge, where black‑box testing is performed with no access to internal details or source code, grey‑box testing provides limited internal knowledge to balance realism and efficiency, and white‑box testing gives full access to source code and application logic to thoroughly validate the entire attack surface.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) You are asked to test an application but are not given access to its source code - what testing process is this?** <br>
**-> Black Box**
<br><br>
**2) You are asked to test a website, and you are given access to the source code - what testing process is this?** <br>
**-> White Box**

**Practical: ACME Penetration Test** <br>
**Description given -> ACME has approached you for an assignment. They want you to carry out the stages of a penetration test on their infrastructure. View the site (by clicking the green button on this task) and follow the guided instructions to complete this exercise.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) Complete the penetration test engagement against ACME's infrastructure.** <br>
