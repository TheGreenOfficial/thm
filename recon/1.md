**Intorduction:** <br><br>
**This room introduces passive vs active reconnaissance, focusing on non-intrusive intel gathering using whois, nslookup, dig, plus DNSDumpster and Shodan to query public WHOIS/DNS data without alerting targets.
No target VM is used-queries are run against TryHackMe-owned domains, requiring basic networking/CLI knowledge and VPN for internet access if not subscribed.**
<br><br>
**Questions:** <br>
**1) Reed information above** <br>
**-> No answer needed**

**Passive Versus Active Recon:** <br><br>
**Reconnaissance is the initial step to gather information about a target. Passive recon uses publicly available info without direct contact, while active recon involves direct engagement with the target.**
**Questions:** <br>
**1) You visit the Facebook page of the target company, hoping to get some of their employee names. What kind of reconnaissance activity is this? (A for active, P for passive)** <br>
**-> P**
<br><br>
**2) You ping the IP address of the company webserver to check if ICMP traffic is blocked. What kind of reconnaissance activity is this? (A for active, P for passive)** <br>
**-> A**
<br><br>
**3) You happen to meet the IT administrator of the target company at a party. You try to use social engineering to get more information about their systems and network infrastructure. What kind of reconnaissance activity is this? (A for active, P for passive)** <br>
**-> A**

<br>

**Whois** <br><br>
**WHOIS is a passive reconnaissance technique used to pull domain registration metadata from public servers. It exposes registrar, dates, contacts (if not private), and name server infrastructure without touching the target directly.**
**Questions:** <br>
**1) When was TryHackMe.com registered?** <br>
**-> 20180705** `//July 5, 2018`
<br><br>
**2) What is the registrar of TryHackMe.com?** <br>
**-> namecheap.com**
<br><br>
**3) Which company is TryHackMe.com using for name servers?** <br>
**-> cloudflare.com**

<br>
<br>

**nslookup and dig** <br><br>
**Nslookup and dig are passive reconnaissance tools used to query DNS records like IPs (A/AAAA), mail servers (MX), and more without touching the target directly. dig is more enterprise‑grade, returning richer metadata like TTL and authority info.**
**Questions:** <br>
**1) Check the TXT records of thmlabs.com. What is the flag there?* <br>
**-> THM{a5b83929888ed36acb0272971e438d78}**

<br>
<br>

**DNS Dumpster** <br><br>
**DNSDumpster is a passive subdomain enumeration tool that finds publicly known subdomains a simple DNS query might miss. It shows DNS servers, resolved IPs, MX and TXT records, and can visualize relationships in a graph to highlight attack surface.**
**Questions:** <br>
**1) Lookup tryhackme.com on DNSDumpster. What is one interesting subdomain that you would discover in addition to www and blog?** <br>
**-> remote**

<br>
<br>

**Shodan.io** <br><br>
**Shodan.io is a passive reconnaissance search engine that indexes exposed internet‑connected devices and services, revealing metadata like IPs, locations, hosting providers, and server software without direct interaction. It’s equally powerful for attackers mapping attack surface and defenders auditing exposure.**
**Questions:** <br>
**1) According to Shodan.io, what is the first country in the world in terms of the number of publicly accessible Apache servers?** <br>
**-> United States**
<br><br>
**2) Based on Shodan.io, what is the 3rd most common port used for Apache?** <br>
**-> 8080**
<br><br>
**3) Based on Shodan.io, what is the most common port used for nginx?** <br>
**-> 80**
